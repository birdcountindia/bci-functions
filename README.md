# BCI Functions (RETIRED)

Originally created as a pre-package repo of functions regularly used in various BCI data tasks. Later, some attempts made at merging multiple repositories together. 

As of October 2024, this repository has been retired and will no longer be maintained. Many of the functions have been/will be incorporated in the [`skimmr` package](https://github.com/rikudoukarthik/skimmr).
